# What is RAG?
* RAG is Retrieval Augmented Generation
It mainly comprises 3 main components as suggested in the name.
* Retrieval: The retrieval part is for getting information through a database, which can be a pdf, an SQL server, or some source. The source can be updated regularly and the information stored can be retrieved, without training.
* Augmented: Augmentation is the part where the information is attached to the generation system and the retrieval system, so now questions can be asked to the LLM in natural language and updated information and domain-specific information can then be output in a natural language format.
